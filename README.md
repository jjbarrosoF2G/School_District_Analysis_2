# School District Analysis

## Overview
### This project is to analyze the data of Math & Reading scores from an entire School District. In order to find new insights on each school's performance, and to provide guidance in budget allocation.

## Results
The analysis was done twice because due to suspicion of dishonesty by some 9th grade students from the Thomas High School.
Round #1 - Included the full data set.
Round #2 - Data for 9th grade students in Thomas High School was replaced with NaN.

- The original summary results for the district were:

- The revised summary results for the district are:

The main changes at this level are:
- Number of schools, students, and budget remain the same, as expected.
- Average reading score also remains similar. However, the rest of the scores are affected:
- Average Math scores decreased by -0.1 pp
- % Passing Math was reduced from 75.0% to 74.8%
- % Passing Reading was reduced from 85.8% to 85.7%
- And, % Overall passing decreased from 65.2% to 64.9

## Summary
The district as a whole has had its average math score decreased, as well as the overall passing percentage for students. Plus, Thomas High School lost its place as a Top five school within the District.
